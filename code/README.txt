addFunct.ex: 
Has two functions: the first one is hello() this will simply print out "Hello World". The second one is sum(a,b). This 
function takes two parameters and resturns their sum. 

To run the program: 
1) Go to terminal
2) Go to the directory where the program is
3) Enter "iex" into the terminal
4) Enter c("addFunct.ex")
5) Enter First.hello() to print "Hello World"
6) Enter First.sum(a, b) where a and b are integers to get their sum
7) Done

To run program follow steps 1-3 starting at line 6:
4) Enter c("p2_calc.ex")
5) Enter SOMETHINGUSEFUL.calculator(operation, valueOne, valueTwo) where operation is the operation of your choice and valueOne and valueTwo are the integers.
6) Done
